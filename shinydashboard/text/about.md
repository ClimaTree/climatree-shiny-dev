## Welcome to the Tree Vulnerabilty Mapping Tool

#### Drought Sensitivity in Mesic Forests

Climate change is having a range of effects on forests (positive and negative). The most concerning impact is the increasing severity and duration of droughts. Droughts have been happening for a very long time but are increasing in duration and severity, due to climate change. Understanding how forests react to drier conditions has been a point of interest for therefore there is a dire need to know how tree growth behaves under climate change.Our client's Dr. Joan Dudney paper titled *Drought Sensitivity in Mesic Forests Heightens Their Vulnerability to Climate Change* is the main inspiration for our research -- Dr. Joan and her colleagues have analyzed 6.6 million tree rings from 122 species to assess trees' sensitivity to water and energy availability. They found that trees growing in wetter portions of their range exhibit the greatest drought sensitivity.

#### Why We Built This Dashboard

To confront the challenges of tree sensitivity mapping, our goal with the dashboard is to create maps that more accurately capture drought sensitivity in different species ranges primarily in wetter colder regions.

We hope this dashboard can act as a tool to map tree vulnerarlity as a result of sentivity to changing climate conditions.

#### The Approach

The Approach to mapping tree species sensitivity builds upon the global tree mapping created from the [Treecenomics Git Hub Repository](https://github.com/rheilmayr/Treeconomics/tree/public) that hosts the tree mapping code from Dr. Joan Dudney's aforementioned paper. 

Tree sensitivity is a relationship of climatic conditions defined by a regression model that takes water and energy availability in its environment as parameters.
