# Mapping Tree Species Sensitivity to Changes in Water Availability

#### Drought Sensitivity in Water Availabilty 

Climate change is having a range of effects on forests (positive and negative). Droughts have been happening for a very long time but the most concerning impact on forests are the increasing severity and duration of droughts. Understanding how forests react to drier conditions has been a point of interest therefore there is a dire need to know which trees are most sensitive to changes in water availability. 

The goal of this project and dashboard is to explore the effect of trees under water deficiency across their species range to the year 2100. We would like to map tree sensitivity at a species level for species found in the International Tree Ring Data Bank 


#### Why We Built This Dashboard

To confront the challenges of species-specific sensitivity mapping, our goal with the dashboard is to create maps that more accurately capture drought sensitivity in different species ranges primarily in wetter colder regions.

We hope this dashboard can act as a tool to map tree vulnerarlity as a result of sensitivity to changing climate conditions.
