# Mapping Tree Species Drought Sensitivity to Measure Vulnerability to Climate Change

#### Drought Sensitivity in Mesic Forests

Climate change is having a range of effects on forests (positive and negative). The most concerning impact is the increasing severity and duration of droughts. Droughts have been happening for a very long time but are increasing in duration and severity, due to climate change. Understanding how forests react to drier conditions has been a point of interest for therefore there is a dire need to know how tree growth behaves under climate change. Dr. Joan Dudney's research is the main inspiration for our this project. We would like to map tree sensitivity at a species level for species found in the International Tree Ring Data Bank 

<!-- have analyzed 6.6 million tree rings from 122 species to assess trees' sensitivity to water and energy availability. They found that trees growing in wetter portions of their range exhibit the greatest drought sensitivity. -->

#### Why We Built This Dashboard

To confront the challenges of tree sensitivity mapping, our goal with the dashboard is to create maps that more accurately capture drought sensitivity in different species ranges primarily in wetter colder regions.

We hope this dashboard can act as a tool to map tree vulnerarlity as a result of sentivity to changing climate conditions.
