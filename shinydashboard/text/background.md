# Mapping Tree Species Sensitivity to Changes in Water Availability

#### Drought Sensitivity in Water Availabilty

Forests cover approximately 30% of Earth's land surface, absorb more carbon than all other terrestrial ecosystems, and provide trillions of dollars’ worth of ecosystem services (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2005). However, forests are increasingly threatened by climate change-induced shifts in drought frequency and severity. As temperatures incease, it is critical to develop effective management strategies and identify techniques to prioritize management interventions. For example, developing cutting-edge models that can identify regions within a species’ range that are more vulnerable to drought can bolster restoration efforts, particularly for threatened species and species exposed to frequent droughts. 

#### Mapping Tree Sensitivty Dashboard

The Mapping Tree Sensitivy Dashboard assses species-specific sensitivity to drought by quantifying variation in drought-sensitivity across tree species’ ranges. This localized information is citical for land managers to develop targeted drought-adaptation strategies. 
By analyzing variation in drought-sensitivity for 26 tree species, we demonstrate that th eimpacts of drier conditions vary by species and across species’ ranges. Our findings suggest that effective management strategies will need to consider species-level variation in drought sensitivity to sustain ecosystem services under climate change.

We hope this dashboard can act as a tool for land management partners to identify regions where management interventions may be needed under climate change.
