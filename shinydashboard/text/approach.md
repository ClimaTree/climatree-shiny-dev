<!-- Our Approach -->

The approach to mapping tree species sensitivity builds upon Dr. Joan Dudney and Dr. Robert Heilmeyer's on-going project to understand how trees respond to climate change. Tree sensitivity is defined as the relationship of historic climatic variables such as climatic water deficit and energy availability in its environment. Because each species will vary across its range to these climatic conditions, our approach is to map each tree species to investigate where sensitivity is higher or lower. 

We developed a reproducible workflow to measure and map how reactive tress are to changes in terms of historic climatic water deficit and energy availability.
