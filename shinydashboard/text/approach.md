<!-- The Approach -->

The Approach to mapping tree species sensitivity builds upon the global tree mapping created from the [Treecenomics Git Hub Repository](https://github.com/rheilmayr/Treeconomics/tree/public) that hosts the tree mapping code from Dr. Joan Dudney's aforementioned paper.

Tree sensitivity is a relationship of climatic conditions defined by a regression model that takes water and energy availability in its environment as parameters.
